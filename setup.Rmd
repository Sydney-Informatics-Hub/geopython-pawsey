We will be connecting Jupyter Notebook Servers hosted on Pawsey's Nimbus Cloud. 
Each server has been pre-configured with the data and code ready to run through these tutorials.
Everyone will be issued with a unique web address.
Go to this site and you are ready to go.

If you are arriving here in the future or would like to set up the environment on your local machine instead, follow these instructions:

# 1. Download the data

Download the data (280 MB inflated to 500 MB) for all the exercises from here:

[https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/IfOvRpOXhJyqTT0](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/IfOvRpOXhJyqTT0)


# 2. Get a Python client
We generally use and recommend Miniconda Python distribution: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). But feel free to use whatever one works for you (and the course materials). We will be using Miniconda3-py37_4.8.3.

You can get this specific version here for:

* [Windows 64 bit Download](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py37_4.8.3-Windows-x86_64.exe)

* [Mac OSX Download](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py37_4.8.3-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg)

* [Linux Download](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py37_4.8.3-Linux-x86_64.sh)

Follow the prompts (the default recommendations in the installer are generally fine.) 
Once installed, launch an "Anaconda Prompt" from the Start Menu / Applications Folder to begin your Python adventure. 

<br>

# 2. Setup your Python environment (install required packages and libraries)

Next we need to set up an environment with all the additional packages and libraries we will be using throughout the course.

* [Download the python environment file from here](requirements/environment.yml) (this is a small text file). You may have to "Right Click > Save link as..." to download it.
* Launch an Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3).

<br>

* Assuming you have downloaded the *environment.yml* file to your Downloads folder. Type in the below command on a Windows machine at the prompt. This should take about 15 minutes to download (~1GB of data) and install the environment packages:

```sh
conda env create --name geopy --file=C:\Users\nbutter\Downloads\environment.yml
```

If you are working on a Mac or Linux machine, the following will work:
```sh
conda env create -f ~/Downloads/environment.yml
```

<br>

Upon successful completion the command prompt should look like this:
![](fig/setup02.png)

![](fig/setup03.png)

<br>

After the installation completes, activate the new environment with the following command:
```python
conda activate geopy
cd C:\Users\nbutter\Desktop\geopython
conda activate geopy
jupyter notebook
```

![](fig/jupyter.png)

This will launch the Notebook server (and may automatically launch a web-browser and take you to the page). If the Notebook does not automatically start, copy the generated link into a browser.

# Other Options

## Google Colab

If the above options do not work for you, [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) can be used for an on-demand Python notebook. You will require a Google Account for this.

The data is also available on Google Drive here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b5TuOIZDhwf1UEMNQ0Jl5zDyn9dRwaRo?usp=sharing

And an example Colab notebook (linking to that data) is here:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Uw78l8SDyRjdeanSvnsGayFWf_AJbZL1?usp=sharing

## Docker

If you are familiar with Docker you may use our Docker image with something like:
```
sudo docker run -it -p 8888:8888 nbutter/geopy:latest /bin/bash -c "jupyter notebook --allow-root --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser"
```
This will launch the Python notebook server in the ```/notebooks``` folder. Access the notebook by entering the generated link in a web-browser, e.g.
```
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=9b16287ab91dc69d6b265e6c9c31a49586a35291bb20d0ab
```
